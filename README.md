# marital-status-and-number-of-children-impact-on-loan-default
In this project, we will use a bankâ€™s data on customers to determine whether their marital status and number of children have an impact on their ability to default on a loan. The conclusions of this project will help later on to build a credit score for potential customers of the bank.
