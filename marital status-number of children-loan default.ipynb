It has negative numbers and unreasonable numbers (like 900+ years of work).

The findings showed that the mean is higher than the median in 5 of 8 income_type groups, which tells us that there are high outliers that pulling the mean up.

    "Also, there is no difference between married and divorced in they ability to repay a loan - it's important data also from sociological point of view. Many people are afraid of divorce due to financial constraints on the part of the financial entities and continue to live together. So a bank that has such a figure, can give the same conditions to both groups, and on the way to being social and fair. This way, the bank's image will also rise among society. \n",

    "The worst customer for the bank is someone with 4 kids, unmarried who wants to buy a car. Education is also a category with high rick to default a loan. \n",

    "So we could highly reccomand to the bank to lower condition for a wedding puprpose loan from 2 reasons:\n",
    "1. Loans for wedding purposes are at the lower group of risk for defaulting a loan. \n",
    "2. Married costomers are also at the lower group of risk for defaulting a loan.\n",

    "**Meaning:** The loan for wedding purpose are most likely to be repyed, so it's beneficial from economical point of view. \n",
